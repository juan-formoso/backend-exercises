# What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a **document-oriented, no sequel (NoSQL)** database.

- **Document based**: represents hierarchical relationship using a single record.

- **Schema Free**: Lesser data migrations.

## Why MongoDB?

1. Flexibility:
   MongoDB notion of documents that can contain sub documents nested in complex hierarchies is really expressive and flexible.

2. Flexible Query Model:
   A user can selectively index some part of a document or query based on attribute values, regular expressions or ranges.

3. Native Aggregation:
   Allows us to extract and transform data from mongodb and either load them in a new format or export it from mongodb to other data sources, it makes it extremely compatible.

4. Schema-less model:
   Applications get the power and responsability to interpret different properties in different ways.
